The repository contains the neural network model source code for protecting digital images of marketplace products.


# Introduction 

Since the task is to develop a method for embedding digital watermarks in images of marketplace products, then the greatest interest is the stability of such a protection method against geometric augmentations of protected images. In this connection, we have defined a set of augmentation / noise, in relation to which training and testing of models will be carried out. The set of augmentations and their parameters are listed in the table below.
